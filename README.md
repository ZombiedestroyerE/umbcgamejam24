This repository is for the code for the (platform cooker) game made for the UMBC hackathon 2024.
 The game is a platformer where you have to fufill orders for food.
 To get the ingrediants you have to do platforming and take the ingrediants back to the kitchen.
 You are given a 3 minute timer by your boss to make as many orders in 3 minutes as possible
